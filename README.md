## Element Links Overview

The HUD is a nice feature but at times, we need the full screen. This plugin will add cp links to all entries and categories. Download links for asset elements and it will also provide front end facing links if urls are enabled for the element in question. In addition, it will also show you where else these related elements are being used.
